# Wine quality detection - Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
This repo is related to the 2021 project of the Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course of Politecnico of Turin. In particular, The project requires discriminating between good and bad quality wines with ML algorithm of classification. The dataset is also taken from the UCI repository. The original dataset consists of 10 classes (quality 1 to 10)

In the folder `data` there are the .txt files related to the train and test split. In the `heatmap` folder there are the heatmap accordin to each class of the dataset and also the heatmap related to dhe whole data without distinctions between classes.
